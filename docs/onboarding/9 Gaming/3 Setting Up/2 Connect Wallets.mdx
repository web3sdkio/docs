# Connect User Wallets

Ask users to connect their wallets to your game. This allows you to ask them to sign transactions.

To [write transactions to the blockchain](/gaming-kit/interact-with-contracts/write-transactions), you must have a connected wallet first.

```csharp
// Ask the user to connect their wallet and read their wallet address.
string address = await sdk.wallet.Connect();
```

## Read Wallet Information

Once connected, you can access information about the user's [Wallet](/unity/Wallet).

```csharp
// For example, we can now read the user's native token balance.
var balance = await sdk.wallet.GetBalance();
```
