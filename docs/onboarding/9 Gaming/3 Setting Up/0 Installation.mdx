# Install The SDK

Our Unity SDK is distributed as a [Unity Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PackagesList.html).

You can download the latest version of the SDK from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/web3sdkio/unity-sdk/releases).

<div className="row">
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
