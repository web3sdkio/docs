# Creating a Marketplace Contract

In this section, we'll show how to:

- Create the marketplace contract that will be used to store our listings
- Configure the metadata such as the name, image, description, and fees of the Marketplace.

To create a [Marketplace](https://portal.web3sdk.io/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) contract,
head to the [dashboard](https://web3sdk.io/dashboard) and connect your wallet.

Then click on the **Deploy New Contract** button.

Select **Marketplace** from the list of contracts and click **Deploy Now**.

Before deploying it, you can configure the contract's **Name**, **Symbol**, and **Description**.

Once you're happy, let's deploy this Marketplace onto the Mumbai (MATIC) Test network.

This will prompt you to accept a transaction in MetaMask (or whatever wallet you connected with),
and deploy your smart contract onto the Mumbai Test network!

You might notice that the transaction requests to Deploy a **Proxy**.

If you want to learn more about proxy contracts, check out our documentation on
[How web3sdkio prebuilt contracts work](https://portal.web3sdk.io/pre-built-contracts#how-web3sdkio-pre-built-contracts-work).

Now we're ready to upload some listings to our Marketplace contract.

## Bonus Tip: SDK Deployments

You can do everything we just did in code using the SDK too!

<Web3sdkioCodeSnippet
  contract={"ContractDeployer"}
  name={"deployMarketplace"}
  showHr={false}
/>
